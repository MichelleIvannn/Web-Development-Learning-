# Command line interface ( CLI )

### Commands&#x20;

* PWD ( Print Working Directory )
* ls ( list ) - prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory
* Cd&#x20;
  * `cd` stands for ‘change directory’, which is a bit misleading
  * The command doesn’t change the directory; it changes the shell’s current working directory.
* cd ..&#x20;
  * is a special directory name meaning “the directory containing this one” or more succinctly
  * &#x20;the **parent** of the current directory.
* `mkdir` -  used to create a new directory or folder in a file system
  * mkdir \<directory\_name>

***

* &#x20;`/` indicates that this is a directory
* \`@´ indicates a link
* `*` indicates an executable

### Getting Help

* ls -- help
  * We can pass a `--help` option to any command&#x20;
* man ls
  * We can read its manual with `man`

### The man command

* The other way to learn about `ls` is to type
* just put the option of man before ls
* `"~"` stands for `/Users/your_username` and sometimes it stands for `/home/your_username`
