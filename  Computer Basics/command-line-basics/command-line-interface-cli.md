# Command line interface ( CLI )

### Commands&#x20;

* PWD ( Print Working Directory )
* ls ( list ) - prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory
* Cd&#x20;
  * `cd` stands for ‘change directory’, which is a bit misleading
  * The command doesn’t change the directory; it changes the shell’s current working directory.
