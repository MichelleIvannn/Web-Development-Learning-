# Command line interface ( CLI )

### Commands&#x20;

* `pwd` ( Print Working Directory )
  * displays the directory (or folder) you're currently in
* `whoami`
  * A simple way to display the username of the currently logged-in user on Unix-like operating system or windows
* `ls` ( list )&#x20;
  * &#x20;prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory
* `cd`&#x20;
  * cd  stands for ‘change directory’, which is a bit misleading
  * The command doesn’t change the directory; it changes the shell’s current working directory.
* `cd ..`&#x20;
  * is a special directory name meaning “the directory containing this one” or more succinctly
  * &#x20;the **parent** of the current directory.
* `mkdir` &#x20;
  *   &#x20;used to create a new directory or folder in a file system

      * `mkdir <directory_name>`
