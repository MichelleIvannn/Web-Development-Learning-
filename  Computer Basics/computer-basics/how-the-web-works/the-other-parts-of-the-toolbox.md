# The other parts of the toolbox

In order for data to get back and forth, we need the following things

### Your internet connection

* Allows you to send and receive data on the internet.

### TCP/IP  (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol )

* are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.
* Example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might travel along the road).

### DNS ( Domain Name System )

* Is like an address book for websites.
* How it works?
  * When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address,&#x20;
  * This is like looking up the address of the shop before you visit it.

### HTTP ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol )&#x20;

* is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
* This is like the language you use to order your goods.

### Files&#x20;

* A website is made up of many different files
* which are like the different goods you buy from the shop
* Code
  * Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Assets
  * This is a collective term for all the other items that appear on a website
  * Such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs
  * that aren't code that the browser interprets.
