# How does the internet work?

### Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi <a href="#wires-cables-and-wi-fi" id="wires-cables-and-wi-fi"></a>

* Information on the Internet moves from one computer to another in the form of bits over various mediums, including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals (i.e., radio waves).

### IP Addresses and DNS <a href="#ip-addresses-and-dns" id="ip-addresses-and-dns"></a>

* Internet protocol&#x20;
  * An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device, website, or application connected to the internet.
* Domain Name System
  * helps translate domain names into IP addresses, allowing clients or servers to locate the actual device or website on the internet.

### Packets, Routing, and Reliability <a href="#packets-routing-and-reliability" id="packets-routing-and-reliability"></a>

* interconnected concepts essential for data transmission across networks
* Packets
  * Data is broken down into smaller, manageable chunks called packets.&#x20;
  * Packets travel independently across the network, potentially taking different routes
  * Each packet contains information like the source and destination IP addresses, allowing routers to identify where it needs to go
* Routing
  * Routers are network devices that forward packets from one network to another
  * They make decisions about the best path for a packet to take based on factors like network congestion, latency, and available routes
  * Routing enables the network to be flexible and fault-tolerant, as packets can be rerouted if a path becomes unavailable.&#x20;
* Reliability
  * The Internet's packet switching approach provides a degree of reliability because packets can be routed around failures or congested paths
