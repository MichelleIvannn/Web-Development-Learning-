# Web Page

### What is Web Page

* A **web page** is a simple document displayable by a browser.
*   A web page can embed a variety of different types of resources such as:

    * _Style information_ — controlling a page's look-and-feel.
    * _Scripts_ — which add interactivity to the page.
    * _Media_ — images, sounds, and videos.

    **Note:** Browsers can also display other documents such as [PDF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/PDF) files and other resources such as images or videos, but the term **web page** specifically refers to HTML documents.

### Unifrom Resource Locator ( URL )

* it's the **address** of something on the internet, like a website, image, video, or file.
