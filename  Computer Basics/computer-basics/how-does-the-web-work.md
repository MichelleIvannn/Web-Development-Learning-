* The router is like a post office: when a packet arrives, it reads the recipient address and forwards the packet to the right recipient directly, without going through layers of relays.
* The box that usally place on the corner table of the sofa

#### ISP ( Internet Service Provider )

* a company that manages some special _routers_ that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers.
* So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network.
